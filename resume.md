Hi! I'm Adam. I'm passionate about math and computers, particularly how the two come together to produce fascinating and meaningful results for the real world. To that end, I'm interested in all aspects of computational mathematics, including machine learning, scientific and high-performance computing, and statistical analysis.

I'm also passionate about Linux and computer infrastructure. I love tinkering with Linux on my personal computer and home server, and participating in [Linux](http://reddit.com/r/archlinux) [and](http://reddit.com/r/linuxhardware) [server](http://reddit.com/r/homelab) forums online. As a software developer with skills in Linux system maintenance, I bring interest and familiarity with the entire software engineering and computing stack.

<!-- Additionally, I'm interested in the intersection of technology and society, especially how techniques such as artificial intelligence both help and hinder humanity at large, from job automation and wide-scale infrastructural change to digital content moderation and interpersonal relationships. -->
